                I've since added a floating betta log, and a whole bunch of tall silk plants, and he's much happier.
                He chills in the log all the time, and rests on the leaves of the plants. Don't forget that betta fins are very, very, delicate,
                so make sure there's nothing in your tank that can snag. A good trick I learned is to drag a nylon stocking through the tank. If it catches on anything,
                that thing is probably not great for bettas. Also make sure your plants aren't blocking your betta from getting to the surface to breathe,
                or accessing other parts of the tank. I even switch out and move the plants and decor around every couple months to keep him entertained.`,

                answer: `Unfortunately any aquarium that receives too little to zero effort will turn into a vile stagnant mess. BUUUUUTTTT, don't let that deter you as this small 3 gallon tank is easy to maintain. Just keep decoration minimal, that will make it easier to clean. Supplies needed for maintenance: any cheap easy magnetic algae scrubber, a 1-2 gallon bucket, and a small aquarium siphon vacuum. Since this is only a 3 gallon tank you will want to only put one fish in, like a beta, unless they are tinier fish then maybe up to 3. Anymore than that and you will want a bigger tank or will have to do more frequent cleanings but if you stick to a Betta then cleaning is easy. Use algae scrubber to clean glass walls, this takes but a minute since it is so small. Siphon the poop out of the gravel after, until you have drained about 1 gallon of water(this will also take but a minute). Dump dirty water, replace with clean water (use just a drop or two of Seachem prime or your choice of dechlorinator). Replace filter cartridge. You can do this once every two weeks or just once a month depending on condition of the tank or time you have. This whole maintenance process will take you just 5minutes. Don't heavily decorate the aquarium, that can make the maintenance process a little taskier since you will want to remove and replace decor... but instead get one nice centerpiece decor and a couple live plants that you will float to offset the highflow of water from the pump`,
